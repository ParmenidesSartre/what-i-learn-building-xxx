# Project 7: What I Learned Building a Policy-Based Access Control Layer

**Core Concept:** Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) vs. RBAC — policy evaluation, conflict resolution, column-level masking, lineage-propagated restrictions.

**Status:** Not started

**Prerequisites:** Projects 01, 02 — Ingestion Engine (data to protect) and Lineage Tracker (policy propagation through derived columns)
