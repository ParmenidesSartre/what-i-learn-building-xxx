**Core Concept:** Data Lineage as a Graph Problem — directed acyclic graphs, graph reachability, audit trails.

**Status:** Not started

**Prerequisites:** Project 01 — Ingestion Engine (lineage events are emitted from the ingestion pipeline)

*Notes, ADRs, and implementation details will be added here as the project progresses.*
