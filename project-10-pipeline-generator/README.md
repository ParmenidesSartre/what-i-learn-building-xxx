# Project 10: What I Learned Building a Metadata-Driven Pipeline Generator

**Core Concept:** Declarative vs. Imperative Pipeline Design — DRY at architecture scale, Jinja2 template generation, plugin/hook escape hatches, template versioning.

**Status:** Not started

**Prerequisites:** Projects 01, 04 — Ingestion Engine and Data Quality Gate (the generator produces pipelines conforming to these patterns)

*Notes, ADRs, and implementation details will be added here as the project progresses.*
