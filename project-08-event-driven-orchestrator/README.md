# Project 8: What I Learned Building an Event-Driven Pipeline Orchestrator

**Core Concept:** Dependency Inversion in Pipelines — event-driven vs. schedule-driven orchestration, partial dependency satisfaction, at-least-once deduplication.

**Status:** Not started

**Prerequisites:** Projects 01, 03 — Ingestion Engine and Backfill System (pipelines being orchestrated must be idempotent)
