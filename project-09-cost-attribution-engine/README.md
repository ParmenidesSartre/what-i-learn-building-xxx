# Project 9: What I Learned Building a Cost Attribution Engine for a Shared Data Platform

**Core Concept:** Chargeback, Showback, and Platform Economics — shared resource disaggregation, tagging compliance, defensible allocation methodology.

**Status:** Not started

**Prerequisites:** Projects 01, 03, 08 — all prior pipelines (cost attribution requires resource tagging conventions established across the platform)
