# Project 5: What I Learned Building a Slowly Changing Dimension Engine

**Core Concept:** Bi-Temporality and the Nature of Historical Truth — valid time vs. transaction time, Type 2 SCD with bi-temporal columns.

**Status:** Not started

**Prerequisites:** Projects 01, 03 — Ingestion Engine and Backfill System (dimension snapshots arrive via ingestion; backfill applies to SCD reprocessing)
